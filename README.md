- [x] Uncommented code for clearing text input.
- [x] Changed x to ❌.

## Getting Started 🗺️
- There are 4 bugs 🕷️ found in the source code of the JavaScript project. Find it, solve it, and open a PR!
- There are **additional freebie pull requests** you can claim by modifying this README file and:
    - Add instructions
    - Fix typos
    - Be creative! (e.g. What is Hacktoberfest about?)
- Not interested in fixing the README? Modify the source code! Add comments, refactor code, mess around!

- ### Instructions
    - *TODO... plz add*

You are encouraged to improve on the source code because that is where your creativity shines and the possibilities are endless!

Idea
- Todo list
    - Editing list creates double entry
    - Delete doesnt auto update until refresh
    - Add button not working
    - Categories doesnt shift
